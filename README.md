# Paros - People-Centric Community Business Model

## Executive Summary

**Paros** exists to serve people first, not profits. In an era where digital platforms too often prioritize shareholder returns over human connection, Paros stands as a critical alternative - a community platform designed fundamentally around human needs, relationships, and collective well-being.

### Mission Statement

_"People before profits, community before capital - building authentic connections that strengthen neighborhoods and heal societal divides."_

### Core Philosophy

Paros rejects the exploitative business models that have dominated the digital economy. We are **people-centric first, business second**. Our approach is deliberately critical of platforms that extract value from communities while eroding social fabric. Instead, we build sustainable revenue streams that enhance community value, never compromise human dignity, and ensure that business serves people rather than people serving business.

**We measure success by community health, not profit margins. Revenue exists to sustain impact, not maximize returns.**

## People-Centric Revenue Philosophy

### Critical Perspective on Digital Exploitation

In an industry rife with exploitation, Paros stands as a deliberate counter-narrative. We critically examine how traditional platforms:

- **Extract value** from human relationships for private gain
- **Monetize attention** at the expense of mental health
- **Create dependency** through manipulative design patterns
- **Prioritize engagement metrics** over genuine human connection
- **Exploit vulnerable communities** for profit maximization

**Paros rejects these practices. We exist to serve people, not exploit them.**

### Human-Centered Business Framework

Our revenue model is fundamentally different - designed around human dignity, community well-being, and sustainable scaling:

- **People First**: Every business decision starts with human impact assessment
- **Community Benefit**: Revenue streams strengthen social bonds, never weaken them
- **Ethical Boundaries**: We draw clear lines between acceptable and exploitative practices
- **Sustainable Scale**: Growth measured by community health, not user numbers
- **Transparent Value**: Users always understand how their contributions create communal benefit

### Revenue Ethics Code

1. **Never Profit from Desperation**: No monetization of emergency situations or vulnerable states
2. **Community Value Creation**: Every revenue stream must demonstrably strengthen community bonds
3. **Equitable Distribution**: Benefits flow to community members, not just platform owners
4. **Transparency Above All**: Users have complete visibility into how revenue is generated and used
5. **Opt-out Freedom**: Users can participate in community without financial pressure
6. **Ethical Pricing**: Costs reflect value provided, never market exploitation potential
